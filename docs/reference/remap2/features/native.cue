		VRL is native to Vector and purpose-built for use within Vector. Both VRL and Vector are written in Rust
		and therefore does not pay a penalty to receive and return Vector events. This makes VRL significantly faster
		than alternative runtimes, like Lua, where data must be serialized as it's passed to and from the runtime.
