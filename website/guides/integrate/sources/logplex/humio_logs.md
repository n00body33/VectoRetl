Logs are an _essential_ part of observing any
service; without them you are flying blind. But collecting and analyzing them
can be a real challenge -- especially at scale. Not only do you need to solve
the basic task of collecting your logs, but you must do it
in a reliable, performant, and robust manner. Nothing is more frustrating than
having your logs pipeline fall on it's face during an
outage, or even worse, disrupt more important services!

Fear not! In this guide we'll show you how to send send logs from [Heroku Logplex][urls.logplex] to [Humio][urls.humio]
and build a logs pipeline that will be the backbone of
your observability strategy.

## What is Heroku Logplex?

[Heroku’s Logplex][urls.logplex] router is responsible for collating and distributing the log entries generated by Heroku apps and other components of the Heroku platform. It makes these entries available through the Logplex public API and the Heroku command-line tool.

## What is Humio Logs?

[Humio][urls.humio] is a time-series logging and aggregation platform for unrestricted, comprehensive event analysis, On-Premises or in the Cloud. With 1TB/day of raw log ingest/node, in-memory stream processing, and live, shareable dashboards and alerts, you can instantly and in real-time explore, monitor, and visualize any system’s data.

## What We'll Accomplish

To be clear, here's everything we'll accomplish in this short guide:

<ol className="list--checks list--flush">
  <li>
    Accept Heroku Logplex data over HTTP.
    <ol>
      <li>Automatically parse incoming data into structured events.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Send logs to the Humio logging service.
    <ol>
      <li>Batch data to maximize throughput.</li>
      <li>Automatically retry failed requests, with backoff.</li>
      <li>Buffer your data in-memory or on-disk for performance and durability.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li className="list--li--arrow list--li--pink text--bold">All in just a few minutes!</li>
</ol>

## How It Works

We'll be using [Vector][urls.vector_website] to accomplish this task. Vector
is a [popular][urls.vector_stars], lightweight, and
[ultra-fast][urls.vector_performance] utility for building observability
pipelines. It's written in [Rust][urls.rust], making it memory safe and
reliable. We'll be deploying Vector as a
[service][docs.strategies#service].

The [service deployment strategy][docs.strategies#service] treats Vector like a
separate service. It is desigend to receive data from an upstream source and
fan-out to one or more destinations.
For this guide, Vector will receive data from
Heroku Logplex via Vector's
[`` source][docs.sources.logplex].
The following diagram demonstrates how it works.

<ServiceDiagram

  sourceName={"logplex"}
  sinkName={"humio_logs"} />

## Tutorial

<div className="steps steps--h3">
<ol>
<li>

### Install Vector

<InstallationCommand />

</li>
<li>

### Configure Vector

<ConfigExample
  format="toml"
  path="vector.toml"
  sourceName={"logplex"}
  sinkName={"humio_logs"} />

</li>
<li>

### Start Vector

```bash
vector --config vector.toml
```

That's it! Simple and to the point. Hit `ctrl+c` to exit.
