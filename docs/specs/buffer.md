# Buffer Specification

This document specifies Vector's buffer behavior for the development of Vector.

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”,
“SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

## Instrumentation

Vector buffers MUST be instrumented for optimal observability and monitoring. This is required to drive various interfaces that Vector users depend on to manage Vector installations in mission critical production environments. This section extends the [Instrumentation Specification].

### When a Vector event is stored in the buffer
* Metric
  * MUST increment the `buffer_event_count` gauge by one
  * MUST increment the `buffer_byte_size` gauge by size of the event
  * MUST update the `buffer_usage_percentage` gauge which measures the current buffer space utilization (number of events/bytes) over total space available (max number of events/bytes).

### When a Vector event is removed from the buffer
* Metric
  * MUST decrement the `buffer_event_count` gauge by one
  * MUST decrement the `buffer_byte_size` gauge by size of the event
  * MUST update the `buffer_usage_percentage` gauge 

### When a Vector event is dropped
* Metric
  * MUST increment the `buffer_discarded_events_total` counter by one
