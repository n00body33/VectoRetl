	description: """
		Because VRL is written in [Rust](\(urls.rust)), VRL is [memory-safe](\(urls.memory_safety)), protected from
		various software bugs and security vulnerabilities that deal with memory acces. This makes VRL ideal for
		infrastructure use case, like observability pipelines, where reliably and security are top concerns.
