## Upgrade guide

### Breaking changes

#### The `vector vrl` timezone flag `-tz` is now `-z` {#vector-vrl-timezone}

We upgraded the Vector CLI to use [Clap v3](https://crates.io/crates/clap), a
popular Rust crate.

A breaking change in Clap v3 is that shortened CLI flags now use the `char`
type, meaning they are restricted to single characters.

As a consequence, the shortened form of our `vector vrl --timezone` flag
(previously `--tz`) has been updated to the more succinct `-z`.
