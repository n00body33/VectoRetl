description: Install Vector through the Nix package manager

Vector can be installed through the [Nix package manager][urls.nix] via
[Vector's Nix package][urls.vector_nix_package]. This package manager is
generally used on [NixOS][urls.nixos].

<Alert type="warning">

Because Vector must be manually updated on Nix, new Vector releases will be
delayed. Generally new Vector releases are made available within a few days.

</Alert>

## Install

1.  Install Vector
    
    ```bash
    nix-env --file https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/master.tar.gz --install --attr vector
    ```

    * The `--attr` improves installation speed.

    </Alert>

### Previous Versions

To our knowledge, historical or specific versions of nix packages cannot be
installed. See [nixpkgs issue #9682][urls.nixpkgs_9682].

## Configuring

The [Vector nix package] does not install any configuration files by default.
You'll need to create a [Vector configuration file][docs.configuration] and pass
it to Vector via the `--config` flag when
[starting][docs.process-management#starting] Vector.

## Administering

The Vector nix package does not use Systemd by default, but Vector does provide
a [Systemd service file][urls.vector_systemd_file] that you can use as a
starting point. How you manage the Vector process is up to you, and the
process administration section covers how to do this:
