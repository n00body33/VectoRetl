## Upgrade guide

### Breaking changes

#### Removal of the `datadog_logs` and `datadog_metrics` sinks' `api_key` setting {#dd-sinks-api-key}

The `api_key` option has been hidden on the documentation for the `datadog_logs`
and `datadog_metrics` sinks for a few releases now, with the documented name for
that setting being `default_api_key`.

In `v0.28.0`, the `api_key` was communicated as deprecated and as part of the
deprecation policy, is fully removed in this release.

Any usages of `api_key` setting in these sinks will no longer work and they
will need to be re-labeled as `default_api_key`.
