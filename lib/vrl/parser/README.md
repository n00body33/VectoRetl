## Fuzzing

This crate supports fuzzing with
[`cargo-fuzz`](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/cargo-fuzz). Please examine the
`fuzz_targets` available in the `fuzz/` directory for available fuzzing
targets. If you are unfamiliar with `cargo-fuzz` please see [the
guide](https://rust-fuzz.github.io/book/cargo-fuzz.html) for details on running
these tests on your system.
