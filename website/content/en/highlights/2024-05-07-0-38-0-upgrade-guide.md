## Upgrade guide

### Breaking Changes

#### The `datadog_agent` source's `parse_ddtags` incorrectly structured the parsed tags {#ddtags-parse-behavior}

The `parse_ddtags` setting which was added in 0.37.0, parsed the `ddtags` comma delimited string of key-value pairs
into an object in the event. This was fixed to correctly parse into an array of `"key:value"` strings, to align
with the Datadog intake.
