Vector's 0.33.0 release includes **deprecations**:

1. [Renaming the `armv7` rpm package](#armv7-rename)
1. [Metadata field in the Vector protobuf definition](#vector-proto-metadata)

We cover them below to help you upgrade quickly:

## Upgrade guide

### Deprecations

#### Renaming the `armv7` rpm package {#armv7-rename}

The `armv7` rpm package, `vector-<version>-1.armv7.rpm`, is now published as
`vector-<version>-1.armv7hl.rpm` to better follow rpm guidelines. The `armv7`
package will be no longer be published beginning in the 0.34.0 release.

#### Metadata field in the Vector protobuf definition {#vector-proto-metadata}

This release adds a new `Metadata` proto Message which is appended to the end of the
`Metric` message of the Vector proto. Prior to this release, the existing `metadata`
field contained only a single field from Vector's `EventMetadata` structure. The
newly added field (`event_metadata`) represents a structure that can contain any
field added that needs to be included from `EventMetadata`.

In order to preserve backwards comatability, the existing `metadata` field is available
to use as-is, but is noted as deprecated.

In a future release, this field index (19) will be fully unsupported and marked as a
`reserved` field in the proto definition. Any users setting the Value `metadata` field
at index 19 should change to populate the `event_metadata.value` instead.
