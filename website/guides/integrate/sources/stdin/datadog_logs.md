Logs are an _essential_ part of observing any
service; without them you are flying blind. But collecting and analyzing them
can be a real challenge -- especially at scale. Not only do you need to solve
the basic task of collecting your logs, but you must do it
in a reliable, performant, and robust manner. Nothing is more frustrating than
having your logs pipeline fall on it's face during an
outage, or even worse, disrupt more important services!

Fear not! In this guide we'll show you how to send send logs from STDIN to Datadog
and build a logs pipeline that will be the backbone of
your observability strategy.

## What We'll Accomplish

To be clear, here's everything we'll accomplish in this short guide:

<ol className="list--checks list--flush">
  <li>
    Accept new line delimited log data through STDIN.
    <ol>
      <li>Automatically enrich logs with host-level context.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Send logs to DataDog.
    <ol>
      <li>Automatically map common fields to Datadog's reserved fields.</li>
      <li>Compress and batch data to maximize throughput.</li>
      <li>Automatically retry failed requests, with backoff.</li>
      <li>Buffer your data in-memory or on-disk for performance and durability.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li className="list--li--arrow list--li--pink text--bold">All in just a few minutes!</li>
</ol>

## How It Works

We'll be using [Vector][urls.vector_website] to accomplish this task. Vector
is a [popular][urls.vector_stars], lightweight, and
[ultra-fast][urls.vector_performance] utility for building observability
pipelines. It's written in [Rust][urls.rust], making it memory safe and
reliable. We'll be deploying Vector as a
[sidecar][docs.strategies#sidecar].

The [sidecar deployment strategy][docs.strategies#sidecar] is designed to
collect data from a _single_ service. Vector has a tight 1 to 1 coupling with
each service. Typically data is collected by tailing local files via Vector's
[`file` source][docs.sources.file], but can be collected through any of Vector's
[sources][docs.sources]. The following diagram demonstrates how it works.

<SidecarDiagram
  platformName={null}
  sourceName={"stdin"}
  sinkName={"datadog_logs"} />

## Tutorial

<div className="steps steps--h3">
<ol>
<li>

### Install Vector

<InstallationCommand />

</li>
<li>

### Configure Vector

<ConfigExample
  format="toml"
  path="vector.toml"
  sourceName={"stdin"}
  sinkName={"datadog_logs"} />

</li>
<li>

### Start Vector

```bash
vector --config vector.toml
```

That's it! Simple and to the point. Hit `ctrl+c` to exit.
