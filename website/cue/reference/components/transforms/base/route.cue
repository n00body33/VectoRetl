			An event matching condition.

			Many methods exist for matching events, such as using a VRL expression, a Datadog Search query string,
			 or hard-coded matchers like "must be a metric" or "fields A, B, and C must match these constraints".

			As VRL is the most common way to apply conditions to events, this type provides a shortcut to define VRL expressions
			 directly in configuration by passing the VRL expression as a string:

			```toml
			 condition = '.message == "hooray"'
			 ```

			When other condition types are required, they can specified with an enum-style notation:

			```toml
			 condition.type = 'check_fields'
			 condition."message.equals" = 'hooray'
			 ```
