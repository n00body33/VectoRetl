## Upgrade guide

### Breaking changes

#### Removal of VRL's modulo operator {#modulo-removal}

VRL's modulo operator (`%`) was deprecated in `0.24.0` and has now been removed. The `mod` function
can be used instead.

Before:

```coffee
5 % 2 == 1
```

After:

```cofee
mod(5, 2) == 1
```

#### Removal of the `new_relic_logs` sink {#new-relic-logs-sink-removal}

In 0.24.0, we [announced][0-24-0-upgrade-guide] that the `new_relic_logs` sink had been deprecated,
and that users should prefer to use the `new_relic` sink instead, which has support not only for
logs, but also metrics and traces.  Switching from `new_relic_logs` to `new_relic` is not as simple
as just changing the sink type field, but it only involves a few small changes which we'll cover
below.

First, you'll have to change the `type` from `new_relic_logs` to `new_relic`. As well, you'll have
to set a field, `api`, to specify that you're sending logs. The value of this field should `"logs"`.

Lastly, you'll need to tweak the credentials used to specify your New Relic account credentials.
With the `new_relic_logs` sink, you had the option to specify either your [Insights insert
key][nr_insights_key] (`insert_key`) or your [License key][nr_license_key] (`license_key`). With the
`new_relic` sink, you can no longer use an Insights insert key, and must use a license key.
Additionally, the [account ID][nr_account_id] must also now be specified.

All put together, here's an example of converting from a `new_relic_logs` sink configuration over to
the `new_relic` sink configuration:

```toml
[sinks.new_relic_logs]
type = "new_relic_logs"
license_key = "xxxx"

[sinks.new_relic]
type = "new_relic"
license_key = "xxxx"
account_id = "yyyy"
api = "logs"
```
