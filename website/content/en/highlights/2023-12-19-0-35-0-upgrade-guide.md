Vector's 0.35.0 release includes **deprecations**:

1. [Deprecation of `file` internal metric tag for file-based components](#deprecate-file-tag)

and **potentially impactful changes**:

1. [HTTP server-based sources now include a `keepalive.max_connection_age_secs` config option that defaults to 5 minutes](#http-keepalive-max-connectino-age)
1. [Update `component_sent_bytes_total` to correctly report uncompressed bytes for all sinks](#component-sent-bytes-total)
1. [Update `component_received_bytes_total` to correctly report decompressed bytes for all sources](#component-received-bytes-total)

We cover them below to help you upgrade quickly:

## Upgrade guide

### Deprecations

#### Deprecation of `file` internal metric tag for file-based components {#deprecate-file-tag}

File-based components (file source, Kubernetes logs source, file sink) now include a
`internal_metrics.include_file_tag` config option that determines whether the `file` tag is included on the
component's corresponding internal metrics. This config option defaults to `true` for now to retain the
existing behavior. In the next release, the config option will be updated to default to `false`, as this
`tag` is likely to be of high cardinality.

### Potentially impactful changes

#### HTTP server-based sources now include a `keepalive.max_connection_age_secs` config option that defaults to 5 minutes {#http-keepalive-max-connection-age}

HTTP server-based sources include a new `keepalive.max_connection_age_secs` configuration option, which defaults to 5 minutes (300 seconds).
When enabled, this closes incoming TCP connections that reach the maximum age by sending a `Connection: close` header in the response.
While this parameter is crucial for managing the lifespan of persistent, incoming connections to Vector and for effective load balancing, it
can be disabled by setting `keepalive.max_sonnection_age_secs` to `null`.

#### Update `component_sent_bytes_total` to correctly report uncompressed bytes for all sinks {#component-sent-bytes-total}

The AppSignal, Datadog Metrics, GreptimeDB, GCP Cloud Monitoring, Honeycomb, and HTTP sinks now correctly
report uncompressed bytes, rather than compressed bytes, for the `component_sent_bytes_total` internal metric.

#### Update `component_received_bytes_total` to correctly report decompressed bytes for all sources {#component-received-bytes-total}

The Heroku Logs, HTTP Server, Prometheus Remote Write, and Splunk HEC sources now correctly report decompressed bytes,
rather than compressed bytes, for the `component_received_bytes_total` internal metric.
