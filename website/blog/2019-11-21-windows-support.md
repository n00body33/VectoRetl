## Getting Started

Installation is as simple as unpacking a `.zip` file. Check out the
[Windows installation instructions][docs.operating_systems.windows] to get started.

## Windows Events

As a follow up to supporting Windows we'll be creating a new `windows_event_log`
source. You can track development onn this source via
[issue #1206][urls.issue_1206].
