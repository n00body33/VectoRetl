## Upgrade guide

### Breaking Changes

#### The Throttle transform's `events_discarded_total` internal metric is now opt-in {#events-discarded-total-opt-in}

The Throttle transform's `events_discarded_total` internal metric, which includes the `key` tag, is now only emitted on
an opt-in basis. Users can opt-in to emitting this metric by setting `internal_metrics.emit_events_discarded_per_key` to `true`
in the corresponding Throttle transform component config. This change is motivated by the fact that the `key` metric tag has
potentially unbounded cardinality.

To view events discarded without the `key` tag, use the `component_discarded_events_total` internal metric.

### Deprecations

#### Deprecation of `file` internal metric tag for file-based components {#deprecate-file-tag}

File-based components (file source, Kubernetes logs source, file sink) now include a
`internal_metrics.include_file_tag` config option that determines whether the `file` tag is included on the
component's corresponding internal metrics. This config option defaults to `true` for now to retain the
existing behavior. In the next release, the config option will be updated to default to `false`, as this
`tag` is likely to be of high cardinality.
