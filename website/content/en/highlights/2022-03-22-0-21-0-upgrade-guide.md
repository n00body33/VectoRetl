Vector's 0.21.0 release includes **breaking changes**:

1. [Syntax changes for non-VRL paths](#path-syntax-changes)
2. [GraphQL API outputEventsByComponentIdPatterns subscription argument `patterns` changed to `outputsPatterns`](#api-patterns-to-outputspatterns)
3. [Deprecated GraphQL API subscriptions have been removed](#removed-deprecated-subscriptions)
4. [The `vector vrl` timezone flag `-tz` is now `-z`](#vector-vrl-timezone)
5. [The `vector top` human_metrics flag `-h` is now `-H`](#vector-top-human-metrics)

And **deprecations**:

1. [`receivedEventsTotal`, `sentEventsTotal`, `sentEventsThroughput`, `receivedEventsThroughput` subscriptions have been deprecated](#deprecate-aggregate-subscriptions)

We cover them below to help you upgrade quickly:

## Upgrade guide

### Breaking changes

#### Syntax changes for non-VRL paths {#path-syntax-changes}

Previously, there were two different ways to describe paths. VRL (remap transforms) use a newer syntax, while everything
else in Vector (templating / all transforms except remap) still used an older syntax. This was a constant pain point for users,
and we have taken some steps to migrate towards the VRL syntax. This is a **breaking change** that may require migration.

The old syntax was very lenient in the characters that were allowed in a field name. It also supported single character escapes.
The new syntax only allows capital/lowercase letters, numbers, and underscore. Any other character will require the field name to be quoted.
Quotes around a field name replace single character escaping. This brings the old syntax in line with the newer (VRL) syntax, except for support
of the "coalescing" operator. The new parser is also faster, and contributed to the increased performance you may see in this release.

Migration will be required for any paths used outside a VRL context. That is any transform (except remap), templating,
and any source or sink referencing field names. There are _no_ changes to the VRL syntax.

Here are some examples that require migrating

| old syntax | new syntax | comment |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| foo\\.bar.baz     | "foo.bar".baz     | The `.` field separator needs to be escaped if used as part of a field name. The old syntax allowed individual character escaping. The new syntax requires quotes around the field name.
| headers.User-Agent | headers."User-Agent" | `-` requires quotes with the new syntax
| foo with spaces | "foo with spaces" | Spaces also need to be quoted

For more information on the new syntax, you can review the documentation [here](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/vrl/expressions/#path)



#### GraphQL API `outputEventsByComponentIdPatterns` subscription argument `patterns` changed to `outputsPatterns` {#api-patterns-to-outputspatterns}

To avoid confusion and align with the new `inputsPatterns` argument, we've
renamed the original `patterns` argument to `outputsPatterns`. `outputsPatterns`
allows you to specify patterns that will match against components (sources,
transforms) and display their _outflowing_ events. `inputsPatterns` allows you
to specify patterns that match against components (transforms, sinks) and
display their _incoming_ events.

Note that using an input pattern to match a component is effectively a
shorthand. It's the same as using one or more output patterns to match against
all the outputs flowing into a component.

Updating your subscriptions is as simple as renaming `patterns` to
`outputsPatterns`.

```diff
- subscription {
-  outputEventsByComponentIdPatterns(patterns: [...])
+ subscription {
+  outputEventsByComponentIdPatterns(outputsPatterns: [...])
```

#### Deprecated GraphQL API subscriptions have been removed {#removed-deprecated-subscriptions}

The following deprecated subscriptions have been removed in this release. Please
use the listed alternatives.

- `eventsInTotal`: use `componentReceivedEventsTotals`
- `eventsOutTotal`: use `componentSentEventsTotals`
- `componentEventsInThroughputs`: use `componentReceivedEventsThroughputs`
- `componentEventsInTotals`: use `componentReceivedEventsTotals`
- `componentEventsOutThroughputs`: use `componentSentEventsThroughputs`
- `componentEventsOutTotals`: use `componentSentEventsTotals`
- `eventsInThroughput`: use `componentReceivedEventsThroughputs`
- `eventsOutThroughput`: use `componentSentEventsThroughputs`

#### The `vector vrl` timezone flag `-tz` is now `-z` {#vector-vrl-timezone}

We upgraded the Vector CLI to use [Clap v3](https://crates.io/crates/clap), a
popular Rust crate.

A breaking change in Clap v3 is that shortened CLI flags now use the `char`
type, meaning they are restricted to single characters.

As a consequence, the shortened form of our `vector vrl --timezone` flag
(previously `--tz`) has been updated to the more succinct `-z`.

#### The `vector top` human_metrics short flag `-h` is now `-H` {#vector-top-human-metrics}

To avoid clashing and issues with our upgrade to [Clap
v3](https://crates.io/crates/clap), the short `-h` from `--help` and `-h` from
`--human_metrics` in the `vector top` command have been disambiguated. The
shortened form for `--human_metrics` is now `-H` and `-h` is reserved for
`--help`.

### Deprecations

#### `receivedEventsTotal`, `sentEventsTotal`, `sentEventsThroughput`, `receivedEventsThroughput` subscriptions have been deprecated {#deprecate-aggregate-subscriptions}

While these subscriptions were intended to display aggregate metrics across all
components, they currently only show a per-component metric and are made
redundant by more informative subscriptions that include specific component
information. To avoid misuse and confusion, we are deprecating them in favor of
the following alternatives.

- `receivedEventsTotal`: use `componentReceivedEventsTotals`
- `sentEventsTotal`: use `componentSentEventsTotals`
- `sentEventsThroughput`: use `componentSentEventsThroughputs`
- `receivedEventsThroughput`: use `componentReceivedEventsThroughputs`
