## Upgrade guide

### Removal of deprecated configuration fields for the Splunk HEC Logs sink: `host` {#splunk-hec-logs-sink-deprecated-fields}

We've removed a long deprecated configuration field from the Splunk HEC Logs
sink: `host`.

You can migrate your configuration by switching to `endpoint` instead.
```diff
 [sinks.splunk]
   type = "splunk_hec_logs"
-  host = "http://splunk-endpoint"
+  endpoint = "http://splunk-endpoint"
   ...
```

### Option name change in Splunk HEC sinks: `token` to `default_token` {#splunk-hec-token-to-default-token}

We've updated the configuration option name `token` to `default_token` in both
the logs and metrics Splunk HEC sinks. Given the new Splunk token passthrough
feature, the `default_` prefix makes it more clear that this token is used when
no other is present in event metadata.

For compatability, we've kept the `token` option name as an alias, but we
recommend you update your configurations as this will be deprecated eventually.
```diff
 [sinks.splunk]
   type = "splunk_hec_logs"
-  token = TOKEN
+  default_token = TOKEN
   ...
```
